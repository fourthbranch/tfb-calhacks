    and show writing decisions for your writing process:

    Use the <note to the readers> field to provide any additional information that is not already included in the content field
    or anything that may contain bias. Use it as often as possible.

    Format:
    [A sentence in the content field](A corresponding source URL)
    [Another sentence in the content field]<A note to the readers>
    [A sentence](A corresponding source URL)<A note to the readers>

    3. cite links to the sources in the content and opposite_view fields based on the "Sources" section in the given report.
    You should not put links that are not provided in the "Sources" section.

    5. come up with an intriguing title for the news article.

    6. You should not come up with a direct quote. You should ensure that every direct quote is actually
    provided in the report. If you cannot find a direct quote, you can use indirect quotes.
